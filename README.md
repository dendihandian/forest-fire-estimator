```
conda create -n streamlit_related python=3.8
```

use the new created env:

```
conda activate streamlit_related
```

install streamlit package:
```
pip install streamlit
```
```
pip install sklearn
```

run the streamlit development server:
```
streamlit run streamlit/app.py
```

## Deployment (Streamlit)

> `streamlit` package already added in the streamlit runtime. no need to install.

install production dependencies:
```
poetry install
```

export production dependencies:
```
poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes > requirements.txt
```
